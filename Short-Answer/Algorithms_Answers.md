#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - runtime dependent on the size of n


b) O(nlogn) - inner loop is log n since j is doubled each time and reaches n in log n time and ends the loop


c) O(n) - recursive call depends on number of bunnies

## Exercise II

If the building is f floors high, we can keep checking the middle like floor
like f//2 and then if it breaks we check the middle of the bottom half and if
it doesn't break then we check the middle of the top half and keep going until
we figure out the floor at which the egg starts breaking from the fall.
